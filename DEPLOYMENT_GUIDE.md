# 🚀 SOLution Game - Deployment Guide

## ✅ Ready to Deploy!

This folder contains everything needed to deploy your SOLution game to Vercel.

## 📋 Quick Steps

### 1. Upload to GitHub
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and create a new repository
2. Name it something like `solution-game` or `sol-game`
3. **IMPORTANT**: Drag and drop the **contents** of this folder directly to the repository root
   - Don't upload the `SOLution-Game-Deploy` folder itself
   - Upload the files inside: `package.json`, `src/`, `public/`, etc.

### 2. Deploy to Vercel
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Click "New Project"
3. Import your GitHub repository
4. Vercel will automatically detect it's a Vite project
5. Click "Deploy" - it should work immediately!

## 📁 What's Included
- ✅ All source code (`src/` folder)
- ✅ All game data (`public/data/` CSV files)
- ✅ All art assets (`public/assets/` images)
- ✅ Build configuration (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `vite.config.ts`)
- ✅ Pre-built for production (relaxed TypeScript settings)

## 🎯 Features Ready
- Character creation with 81 combinations
- 4 migration routes (Student, WHV, Graduate, Offshore)
- Mobile-optimized 9:16 layout
- Art gallery integration
- Local and global ending system
- CSV-driven event system

## 🔧 If Deployment Fails
1. Check that all files are in the repository root (not in a subfolder)
2. Make sure `package.json` is in the root directory
3. Verify the build works locally: `npm run build`

## 📱 Test Your Deployment
Once deployed, test on mobile devices to ensure the 9:16 layout works correctly.
